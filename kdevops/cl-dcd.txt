The patch series add test workflow for CXL dynamic capacity
device (DCD) in Qemu.

Patch 1: add new options in kconfig to enable qmp interface for qemu so qemu
can be launched with qmp interface enabled, which is needed for CXL test like
error injection, dynamic capacity extent add/release.
Patch 2: add a new cxl topology where a DCD device is directly attached to the
root port of a host bridge.  For the device itself, it has no static volatile
or non-volatile capacity but only dynamic regions with no DC extents added yet.
Path 3: add a new make command "cxl-create-dc-region" to create DC
region for dynamic capacity, which is needed before dc extents can be
added. We also fixed "make cxl" command as the regular cxl-mem-setup
worklfow does not work for dcd device.
Patch 4: add a new make command "cxl-dcd-setup" to add dc extents, and
convert dynamic capacity to system ram and online it.

With the patch series, we can play with DCD device in two ways,
First workflow:
After system bringup, run "make cxl"  which will create DC region, create dax
device and convert it to system ram.

The other workflow:
After system bringup, and if ndctl is already available in the guest,
perform the following two steps:
1) make cxl-create-dc-region: create a DC region;
2) make cxl-dcd-setup: add dc extents, create dax device and convert it to
system ram.
