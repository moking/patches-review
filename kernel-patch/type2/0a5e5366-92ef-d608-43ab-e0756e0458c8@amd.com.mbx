Well, that "EFI Reserved" is what we want. However, AFAIK, it is 
EFI_MEMORY_SP the only one being discussed with our BIOS/UEFI contacts.

Because how to assign those flags seems to be based on BIOS 
implementation, we count on some BIOS versions doing the wrong thing for 
our purposes, so I have been working on a workaround implying udev 
events and executing a modified daxctl for switching a dax device mode 
or even removing/destroying it.

Anyway, that "EFI Reserved" flag gives up hope.

I did not see that. So, happy to know we are in the same page here.

I basically took your patchset referenced in the RFC, specifically the 
19th one, and tried to work with it from a pcie/CXL device driver. I did 
debug all the problems precluding the CXL invoked function to succeed 
and applying those changes from previous patches required and not 
committed yet. Patches 7, 8, 9 and 11 are based on your patchset, with 
just some minor change since I did not see a reason for changing them 
after studying them. The other patches are those fixes for having a 
Type2 finally able to create a dax region and map it.

You know I could not add to a netdev driver just those changes for CXL 
initialization, then mapping a CXL region and doing nothing else. Such a 
mapping needs to be linked to something inside the driver what is just 
under development and testing.

Sure. FWIW, this will end up changing a internal driver mapping HW 
buffers which are now based on PCI BAR offsets by same mapping based on 
CXL region mapping.

This involves, PFs and VFs, and because CXL is only advertised by PF0, 
this all brings more complexity to those changes than could be expected.

I think taking the CXL core to the support needed, hopefully based on 
this RFC, should be started as soon as possible instead of waiting for 
our driver/device to be ready.

Yes. I'm actually using qemu hmem and kernel efi_fake_mem for some 
testing about those workarounds, so happy to help with new qemu support 
for the "EFI Reserved" case as well.

OK. I'll take a look to those pmem needs.

Ok. I'll do the changes for next versions.

If a Type2 is fully private, should be any sysfs files about it?

AFAIK, those files are mainly for user space able to create memories 
joining them, or for changing the dax mode. What do you think a Type2 
needs through sysfs apart from info? While writing this I realize I have 
not thought about power management ...

That would be great!

If this RFC work is integrated by then with the CXL core, that would be 
fantastic, but the CXL.cache support will still be pending.

Uhmmm ... I have problems understanding this but I guess there's a good 
reason for it.

That makes sense, but I wonder if we should have some function for doing 
default initialization of those fields like this which some users, like 
an accelerator with no pmem, will likely leave untouched.

Maybe inside cxl_accel_state_create in patch2 something like this:

     cxlds->dpa_res = DEFINE_RES(0, -1);

     cxlds->ram_res = DEFINE_RES(0, -1);

     cxlds->pmem_res = DEFINE_RES(0, -1);

Well, tell your BIOS contacts that they need to honor what the device
puts in the CDAT for the memory-type, not just make it up on their own.

Yikes, no, lets not do that. Another thing we can do from the kernel
side, in case the CDAT is missing, is to never attach device-dax to
address ranges within CXL windows with the "Device Coherent Window
Restriction".

Ok, let's not add dax region's for this case, but the rest sounds
straightforward, I'll take a look.

Ok, you're just talking about pre-plumbing the CXL bits before getting
started on the netdev side. Makes sense to me.

I agree, but continued transparency on what the CXL use case looks like
in the final implementation helps make sure the right upstream CXL
mechanism is being built.

For example, just from that insight above I am wondering if we need some
centralized interface for VFs to lookup / allocate CXL resources from
their PF0.

They are primarily for userspace to enumerate resources, and they
provide kernel object names for CXL error events. For example userspace
could generically map a CXL switch error to impacted endpoints without
needing to know or care whether it was a type-2 or type-3 endpoint.

Sounds good.

Yes, we need to sync with these guys :-)

EFI_MEMORY_SP was our/my only focus and that is probably the problem and 
the confusion.

BTW, How can the kernel warn about this? I guess this requires the 
driver raising it. doesn't it?

I do not want to put my reputation on this workaround, but I see it as a 
first and quick fallback and not requiring kernel changes to CXL/DAX. My 
idea is to add some interface between drivers and DAX for doing this if 
necessary, once the driver tries to get the resource and it fails. Maybe 
with some kernel boot param like dax_allow_change=drivername or 
something similar. What else could we do for the case of the BIOS/kernel 
doing the wrong thing?

Not in our case, but it could be needed (or convenient) for more complex

That makes a lot of sense. Then I'm afraid I should work on this. I'll 
try to find out if it could be just modifying current patchset with 
minor changes.

Thanks

that infrastructure for initialization.

From: Alejandro Lucero <alejandro.lucero-palau@amd.com>

I need to start this RFC explaining not what the patchset does, but what we
expected to obtain and currently is under doubt: to configure a CXL memory
range advertised by our CXL network device and to use it "privately".

The main reason behind that privacy, but not the only one, is to avoid any
arbitrary use by any user-space "client" with enough privileges for using a
public interface to map the device memory and use it as regular memory. The
reason is obvious: the device expects writes to such a memory in a specific
format.

The doubt comes from the fact that after implementing the functionality exposed
in this patchset, we realized the current expectation seems to be a BIOS/UEFI
configuring HDM decoders or HPA ranges and passing memory ranges to the kernel,
and with the kernel having a default action on that memory range based on the
flag EFI_MEMORY_SP being set or not. If it is not set, the memory range will
be part of the kernel memory management, what we do not want for sure. If the
flag is set, a DAX device will be created which allows an user-space client to
map such a memory through the DAX device API, what we also prefer to avoid. I
know this is likely going to face opposition, but we see this RFC as the
opportunity for discussing the matter and, if it turns out to be the case, to be
guided towards the proper solution accepted by the maintainers/community. This
patchset does not tackle this default kernel behaviour although we already have
some ideas and workarounds for the short term. We'll be happy to discuss this
openly.

So, this patchset assumes a BIOS/UEFI not programming the HDM decoder or HPA
ranges for a CXL Type2 device. Although maybe a weird assumption as explained
above, a Type2 device added after boot, that is hotplugged, will likely need the
changes added here. Exporting some of the CXL core for vendor drivers is also
required for avoiding code duplication when reading DVSEC or decoder registers.
Finally if there is no such HPA range assigned, whatever the reason, this patchset
offers some way of obtaining one and/or finding out what is the problem behind the
lack of such HPA range.

Current CXL kernel code is focused on supporting Type3 CXL devices, aka memory
expanders. Type2 CXL devices, aka device accelerators, share some functionalities
but require some special handling.

First of all, Type2 are by definition specific to vendor designs and a specific
vendor driver is expected to work with the CXL specifics. This implies the CXL
setup needs to be done by such a driver instead of by a generic CXL PCI driver
as for memory expanders. Most of such setup needs to use current CXL core code
and therefore needs to be accessible to those vendor drivers. This is
accomplished with the first patch and with extensions to the exported functions
in subsequent patches.

Keeping with kernel rules of having a client using any new functionality added,
a CXL type2 driver is increasingly added. This is not a driver supporting a real
device but an emulated one in QEMU, with the QEMU patch following this patchset.

The reason for adding such a Type2 driver instead of changes to a current kernel
driver or a new driver is threefold:

1) the expected kernel driver to use the functionality added is a netdev one.
   Current internal CXL support is a codesign effort, therefore software and
   hardware evolving in lockstep. Adding changes to a netdev driver requires the
   full functionality and doing things following the netdev standard which is
   not the best option for this development stage.

2) Waiting for completing the development will delay the required Type2 support,
   and most of the required changes are unrelated to specific CXL usage by any
   vendor driver.

3) Type2 support will need some testing infrastructure, unit tests for ensuring
   Type2 devices are working, and module tests for ensuring CXL core changes do
   not affect Type2 support.

I hope these reasons are convincing enough.

I have decided to follow a gradual approach for adding such a driver using the
exported CXL functions and structs. I think it is easier to review the driver
when the new funcionality is added than to add the driver at the end, but not a
big deal if my approach is not liked.

The patches are based on a patchset sent by Dan Williams [1] which was just
partially integrated, most related to making things ready for Type2 but none
related to specific Type2 support. Those patches based on Dan´s work have Dan´s
signing, so Dan, tell me if you do not want me to add you.

Type2 implies, I think, only the related driver to manage the CXL specifics.
This means no user space intervention and therefore no sysfs files. This makes
easy to avoid the current problem of most of the sysfs related code expecting
Type3 devices. If I´m wrong in this regard, such a code will need further
changes.

A final note about CXL.cache is needed. This patchset does not cover it at all,
although the emulated Type2 device advertises it. From the kernel point of view
supporting CXL.cache will imply to be sure the CXL path supports what the Type2
device needs. A device accelerator will likely be connected to a Root Switch,
but other configurations can not be discarded. Therefore the kernel will need to
check not just HPA, DPA, interleave and granularity, but also the available
CXL.cache support and resources in each switch in the CXL path to the Type2
device. I expect to contribute to this support in the following months, and
it would be good to discuss about it when possible.

Alejandro.

From: Alejandro Lucero <alucerop@amd.com>

Differientiating Type3, aka memory expanders, from Type2, aka device
accelerators, with a new function for initializing cxl_dev_state.

Adding a type2 driver for a CXL emulated device inside CXL kernel
testing infrastructure as a client for the functionality added.

From: Alejandro Lucero <alucerop@amd.com>

CXL Type 2 devices imply specific vendor drivers binding to those
devices instead of generic ones offered by CXL core like the PCI driver.
Those drivers need to use CXL core functions and structs for
initialization, create memdevs and create CXL regions.

This patch avoids referencing those files based on relative paths from
inside the kernel sources tree.

From: Alejandro Lucero <alucerop@amd.com>

Current check is using resource_size which counts on a range bigger than
0. For a resource with start and end being 0, resource_size returns 1
and implying a false positive. Use the end not being zero as the new check.

Note: If I´m not missing anything here, this should be extended to the
whole linux kernel where resource_size is being used in conditionals,
and where the likely right fix is to modify resource_size itself
checking for the range not being 0.

mapping does not show such capability, do not treat that as an error.

From: Alejandro Lucero <alucerop@amd.com>

Adding memdev creation to the cxl type2 test driver.

Current cxl core is relying on a CXL_DEVTYPE_CLASSMEM type device when
creating a memdev leading to problems when obtaining cxl_memdev_state
references from a CXL_DEVTYPE_DEVMEM type. This last device type is
managed by a specific vendor driver and does not need same sysfs files
since not userspace intervention is expected. This patch checks for the
right device type in those functions using cxl_memdev_state.

From: Alejandro Lucero <alucerop@amd.com>

Creating a CXL region requires userspace intervention through the cxl
sysfs files. Type2 support should allow accelerator drivers to create
such cxl region from kernel code.

Adding that functionality and integrating it with current support for
memory expanders.

Based on the requirements from the endpoint and the topology such an
endpoint is attached to, this function informs about maximum host
physical address space possible to request. This is not a reservation
but only information which could change at the point the request based
on this information is made.

Lets clear up this confusion first.

My expectation for CXL accelerator provided memory is that it is marked "EFI
Reserved" in the memory map (or CDAT), not "EFI Conventional + Special Purpose
Attribute". Recall that the EFI_MEMORY_SP attribute is just a *hint* that OS may
*not* want to consider a memory range as part of the general purpose memory
pool. CXL Accelerator Memory is far from that definition. If a driver needs to
be loaded to effectively use a memory range that is not a range that can be
transparently converted to "EFI Conventional Memory".

It may have been subtle, but even in my initial RFC [1]. I was explicitly
skipping exposing accelerator memory via device-dax:

At least for Linux it should not care whether BIOS maps it or not. The
expectation is that whichever agent maps it, BIOS or Linux CXL core, that agent
honors the memory type specified in the device CDAT. I.e. the "Device Scoped EFI
Memory Type Structure (DSEMTS)" in the accelerator CDAT should pass "2" in the
"EFI Memory Type and Attribute" field, where "2" indicates "EFI Reserved" memory
type for any HPA that maps this device's DPA.

Yes, that was the whole point of the "Device Memory Setup" thread [2] to show a
plausible way to reuse the common core infrastructure for accelerators with
CXL.mem capability.

[2] https://lore.kernel.org/all/168592149709.1948938.8663425987110396027.stgit@dwillia2-xfh.jf.intel.com/

It would help me if you can summarize what you did and did not adopt from that
proposal, i.e. where it helped and where it missed the mark for your use case.

[..]

Lets start with the deltas compared to [2], the observation there is that much
of the CXL core is reusable for this type-2 use case, and even improves the
organization of the core. The consumer of the refactoring just ends up being a
few new helpers around the core.

Not sure what "netdev standard" means, and not sure it matters for a discussion
that is constrained to how the CXL core should evolve to accommodate
accelerator-local memory.

Again, [2] already path cleared the idea that early plumbing of the CXL core for
type-2 is in scope. Just need to make sure this effort is focused on general CXL
specification use cases.

I am happy to have general specification discussions about core functionality
that all CXL accelerators need and plumbing those ABIs to be exercised via
something like cxl_test.

I expect that cxl_test only covers coarse grained inter-module ABIs and that the
fine details will need to wait until the accelerator specifics are closer to
being disclosed and the real driver patches can start flowing. In other words, I
am not keen to see QEMU used as a way to proxy features into the kernel without
disclosing what the real world consumer actually needs.

Now, that said, there may also be opportunity for targeted extensions of the
QEMU CXL memory-expander device, like DPA capacity that is mapped as "EFI
Reserved" device-memory, but lets talk about the specifics here.

Also recall that the current CXL driver does not yet support parsing CXL PMEM
region labels. Support for that ends up looking quite similar to an accelerator
asking for a specific DPA range to be dynamically mapped by the CXL core. So I
think we can get quite far along the path to enabling type-2-CXL.mem just by
flushing out some of the generic type-3-CXL.mem use cases.

It is fine to reuse those patches, but please do include:

Co-developed-by: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com>
Link: <lore-link for copied code>

...so I can try to remember if I still think the source patch was a good idea or
not. Again, a summary analysis of what did and did not work for you from that
posting would help me get a running start at reviewing this.

Not sure what you mean here, I am hoping that sysfs ABI for enumerating objects
like memdevs, decoders, and regions "just works" and is hidden from the
accelerator vendor driver.

Yup, especially CXL 3.x Cache ID management. Lets talk about some ways to plumb
that, because it is also a general CXL specification capability. Another topic
is what is needed for CXL Protocol and Component error handling, I expect some
of that to be CXL core common and some of that to be accelertor driver
augmented.

If you think we will still be talking about this driver enabling in September
I would invite you to submit this as a topic for the CXL uConf.

If you are going to keep Dan's sign-off it needs to be clear why.
Either put the author to Dan and swap these two, or use a
Co-developed tag.

A few drive my trivial comments.

If you are removing this check from the shared code, it needs to be
in the more specific code, or you need to state why that isn't
a problem (i.e. it is caught later anyway)

The start and end being 0 is a valid resource of length 1 so that
should not need fixing.

These should have been initialized with DEFINE_RES_MEM()
/ DEFINE_RES_NAMED()
That will happily set the .end to -1 resulting in a wrap around
so that you get all bits set.

Sometimes this gives slightly confusing range prints but otherwise
I think it is fine.
